Dice Manager is an elegant solution to solving the ever-challenging memory-posed problem of connections. Utilizing Dice Manager, you can manage your connections, custom wrap calls, and create a queue task scheduler. Dice Manager provides all the barebone tools you can use to hook events & custom connections to, allowing you to avoid the hassle of `table.insert` for all of your event loggings by using the `:ConnectKey()` method.
